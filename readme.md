a monogame implementation of the separating axis theorem for convex polygon intersection

---

to generate the necessary `.xnb` files, run:

```bash
$ mgcb --outputDir=bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.1 --build=Content/textures/circle.png
```

possible extensions

- [ ] improved api for translating and rotating polygons
- [ ] circle collision
- [ ] convex decomposition
- [ ] exception handling
- [ ] capturing intersections as polygons
